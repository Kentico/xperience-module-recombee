<p>Every coffee has a story to share. We want this story to reach you in the most unaltered of ways.</p>

<p>Estate coffees and micro-lots from diverse varietals located all over the globe. You can taste the world with Dancing Goat.</p>

<p>We know every our farmer personally. These are mostly family businesses that have been up and running for decades. They do what they love and hand-pick their produce with care. We make sure they get as much from our relationships as we and you do.</p>

<p>Every bean in our stock is 100% traceable to its source. Clean both for the eye and the environment. The beans are always of the latest season&mdash;we never store more coffee than we have to.</p>
