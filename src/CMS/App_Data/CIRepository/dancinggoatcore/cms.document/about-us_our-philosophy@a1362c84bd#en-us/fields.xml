<p>At Dancing Goat, we strive to do things right. Not only do we source the best coffees you can get your hands on. We also make sure we have a direct relationship with our farmers. Visiting the micro farms where we source our coffees is our daily bread. This way, we can guarantee the highest quality standard all year long. No middle-men, no unfair shares. Our farmers get the best deal possible. So do you.</p>

<p>Stop by, relax, and put your mind at ease. There are no distractions at Dancing Goat, it&rsquo;s just you and your cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Each one of us is a coffsee enthusiast, but you don&rsquo;t have to be an aficionado to enjoy the best. Ask us anything, we will happily take you on a tour of everything we have to offer. Many of our baristas meet our farmers personally. They know firsthand.</p>

<p>Dancing Goat is a place where the revival of alternative coffee preparation methods takes place. Come and see us extract the best coffee in a vacuum coffee maker or in the charming Chemex.</p>
